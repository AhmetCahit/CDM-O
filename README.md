  Semantic modelling for the Internet of Things has become the basis for solving the problem of interoperability, given the distributed and heterogeneous nature of "objects". While most of the current research focuses primarily on modelling devices and services, it has also made little effort to keep in the format for accessing, using, and analysing information generated by objects. However, most of the Internet of Things solutions suffer from the lack of working in distributed environments and the inability to manage data from different test environments. Today, cloud applications can be shown as a solution to these problems with its platform-independent structure and flexible scaling features. In this study, developed data models specific to application areas of Internet of Things in the literature were examined and an abstraction layer model was created to represent data from heterogeneous environments as much as possible.
